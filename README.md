While VS Code can attempt automatic debugging, a launch configuration provides more control.
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
Type "launch.json: configure" and select the command.
Follow the prompts to choose your program type (e.g., Python File).
This creates a launch.json file (usually in a .vscode folder) to define debugging behavior.
Write your Program: Create your program code in a supported file type (e.g., .py for Python).

Set Breakpoints (Optional):

Click next to the line of code where you want to pause execution.
This adds a red dot, indicating a breakpoint.
Start Debugging:

Press F5 (or go to Run and Debug > Start Debugging).

VS Code will launch your program in debug mode.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific lines of code.
Step Through Code: Execute code one line at a time (F11) or step over function calls (F10).
Inspect Variables: View the values of variables at any point during execution.
Call Stack: See the sequence of function calls leading to the current point.
Console: Interact with your program's input/output during debugging.
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger under certain conditions.
Source Control Integration: Step through code changes and see how they affect execution.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
